## What’s This All About?

Ever wanted a smooth shopping spree from your couch? Ebazaar has got you covered with:

- Browsing cool products (no pushy salespeople included)  
- Viewing juicy product details — you get to drool over images and read all about it  
- Adding stuff to your cart *and* wishlist (because sometimes you want it now, sometimes later)  
- Sharing products with friends and maybe pretending you discovered the next big thing first  
- Seeing similar goodies so you can “accidentally” spend more

## The Magic Behind the Scenes 

Here’s what makes the magic happen:

- **React + TypeScript**: The dynamic duo powering your shopping journey  
- **React Router**: So you don’t get lost between pages  
- **React Query**: Because fetching data should be as smooth as butter  
- **Context API**: For keeping track of your cart and wishlist — like a helpful shopping buddy  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Making things pretty without losing our minds  
- **Lucide Icons**: Fancy little icons that make buttons look good
